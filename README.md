Pastekaro

Pastekaro is a simple, user-friendly web application that allows users to paste text or code and generate a unique link to access it. The content is view-only, with no authentication required, making it quick and easy to share snippets or notes with others.

Features

Shareable Link: Get a unique link to share the content with others.
No Authentication: Paste without needing to log in or create an account.
View-Only: The pasted content is only viewable and copyableâ€”no editing allowed.
Simple Interface: Clean and minimalistic design for easy usage.

How It Works
Creating a Paste: Users can type or paste text into the input area and click "Create Paste."
Accessing the Paste: A unique link will be generated, which the user can share. The link will lead to a page where the paste content is displayed in a read-only view.
Deleting Pastes: Pastes will be stored for a certain period or until manually removed. The link will not be editable by the user.
