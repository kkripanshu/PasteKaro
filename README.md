How It Works

Creating a Paste: Users can type or paste text into the input area and click "Create Paste."

Accessing the Paste: A unique link will be generated, which the user can share. The link will lead to a page where the paste content is displayed in a read-only view.

Deleting Pastes: Pastes will be stored for a certain period or until manually removed. The link will not be editable by the user.
